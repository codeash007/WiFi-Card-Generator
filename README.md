# WiFi-Card-Generator
This project provides a simple web-based tool to generate WiFi QR codes for easy sharing of network credentials. Users can input their WiFi network name (SSID) and password, and the application will dynamically generate a QR code that, when scanned by a smartphone, allows for quick connection to the specified WiFi network
